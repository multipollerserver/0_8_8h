###########################################


Savety first! 
Pleace make an backup from your database before testing the plugin.
I get no warranty for currectly working of the plugin.
Pleace try the plugin not on your hot systems.
The plugin only worky on cacti version 0.8.8h on system unix

###########################
- Copy the the plugin in the cacti plugindirectory.

- Under Plugin Management click on install an set an pollermaster.
	This server ist now ready for polling an handle all plugins in cacti.
	The function for enable and disable comming soon.

- The following commands must run on terminal in cacti path:
	sudo patch -p0 -b -N < plugins/multipollerserver/patches/update_multipollerserver_088h.patch 

	This files are updatet
	patching file poller.php
	patching file lib/poller.php
	patching file lib/api_poller.php

	3 backupfiles become create.

- Set Realm Permissions in usermanagement "Plugin -> Pollerserver: Configure".
- Set any Pollerserver for polling devices.
- Aktivate the Pollerserver.

2 Ways to configurate the device <--> pollerserver.
	First:
	- Choose the device to an Pollerserver.
		- On Management -> Device choose one Pollerserver from DropDown.
	Second:
	- Choose any devices from an devicelist.
	! In this list are only devices how existing graphs.!
		- On Management -> Multi-Pollerserver -> Choose Devices for Pollerserver
		- Choose the devices and put them to an pollerserver.
		

	!!!!!!!!!!!!
	The Mastersever has always the ID 2 an can not be delete from cacti

Should be any problems than take an "Rebuild Poller Cache"
